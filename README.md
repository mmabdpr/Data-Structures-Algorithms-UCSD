# Data Structures and Algorithms

These are my solutions to coding challenges of UCSD course series (specialization) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms).

I have solved these challenges as part of my university coursework.

All solutions are implemented from scratch using the C# language.

Some files of my original codebase have been deleted as they may violate the course policies.
